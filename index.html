    <h3>CitiBike Usage in New York City</h3>
    <p>For our project, we will look at CitiBike usage in New York City neighborhoods and compare the concentration of rides starting at each neighborhood. 
    We want to see if CitiBikes are an effective alternative means of transportation by visualizing it against the NYC Subway System and the 
    percentage of people who own a car in each neighborhood tabulation area.</p>
